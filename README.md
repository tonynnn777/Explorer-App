# My Personal Project
## World Explorer

**What will the application do?**


The application will serve as a *guide* for discovering fun and interesting places to visit around the world. Users can browse through various categories of attractions such as parks, cafes, museums, and outdoor activities. The app will also enable users to plan their trips by creating personalized  lists, where they can add or remove destinations based on their preferences.

**Who will use it?**

Anyone looking for a trip involving an interesting or fun location to visit by themselves or with friends.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

Google Maps has always been my go-to app for discovering new places. However, it’s not ideal for keeping track of all the locations I want to visit. This project aims to create a more personalized experience, allowing users to save, organize, and revisit their favorite spots easily.
