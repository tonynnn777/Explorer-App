# My Personal Project
The application will serve as a **guide** for discovering fun and interesting places to visit in the *Lower Mainland, BC*. Users can browse through various categories of attractions such as parks, cafes, museums, and outdoor activities. The app will also enable users to plan their trips by creating personalized "Go To" lists, where they can add or remove destinations based on their preferences.

The application is designed for **locals** such as students or **toursists** who are looking to explore new places and activities in the *Lower Mainland*. It is suitable solo or with groups of friends who want to discover unique spots, popular destinations, and hidden gems in the area.

This project interests me because I love **exploring** new places and sharing them with others. I believe this app will help highlight the unique spots I've discovered in the *Lower Mainland* and encourage more people to experience them.
